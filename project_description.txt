Course project
CS550
1
Overview
The project involves designing and rendering the classroom CL-3 (South
Campus) in OpenGL. This should include walls, ceiling, doors, windows and
light-sources of the room as well as benches, tables, podium and green-board.
Rest of the furnishings are optional. The number, relative positions and
dimensions of the above mentioned parts/items should match those in the
real classroom.
The project is to be executed in teams of two. All the code and digital
assets must be authored by you. It is strictly prohibited to download any
of these from the internet, which includes use of automated code generation
softwares such as ChatGPT. You may use the Blender software for modelling
the shapes.

ing, which can be chosen between at run time using input from the
keyboard.
4. Mouse and keyboard interaction: Move the camera using the input
from mouse and keyboard. Six keys from the keyboard translate the
camera along the three axes while input from the mouse is used to
change the orientation of the camera.
5. Shadow mapping: Generate shadows using Poisson sampling, as dis-
cussed in the class.
